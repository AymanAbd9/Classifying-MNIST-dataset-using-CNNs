# Classifying MNIST Dataset using CNNs

This project demonstrates the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify the MNIST dataset, a collection of handwritten digits commonly used in machine learning tasks.

## Features
- Training a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Evaluation of model performance, including accuracy metrics.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pickle`

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed. You can install missing dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
   ```
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment.
3. Run each cell sequentially to train and evaluate the CNN model.

## Sections
- **Training**: The notebook includes code to train a CNN model on the MNIST dataset.
- **Evaluation**: After training, the model's performance is evaluated using accuracy.
